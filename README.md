# Spinnaker Demo

This is just a quick demo application to show off the abilities of Spinnaker and deploying to Google Cloud.

The app will print out the Google availability zone and a version number to show that the app was updated on deployments
and to demo Spinnaker rollbacks. 

Very basic Go app using net/http for request handling.
